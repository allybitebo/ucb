				1. <strong>General Regulations</strong><br />
				1.1 Student credit transfer is allowed between Universities only. 1.2 Credit transfer applies to both undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes. 1.3 Credit transfer can only be allowed if such credits have been obtained within a period of not more than two years. 1.4 Students discontinued from other universities are not allowed to transfer credits to the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). 1.5 Students will be required to undertake at least Â¨Ã¸ of degree programme credit units at UDSM. Maximum credit allowable for transfer, therefore, is Â¨Ã· of the required credit units of a UDSM degree programme. 1.6 UDSM students on study-abroad programmes shall be allowed to transfer credits obtained from the other University to UDSM.<br />
				2. Conditions governing credit transfer from other Universities to UDSM<br />
				2.1 The Higher Education institution from which a student wants to transfer credit from must be a University with full accreditation by a recognized body in the country assigned to deal with such matters and the accreditation status of the institution shall be independently verified by UDSM and the Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU). If in doubt . UDSM reserves the right to give any applicant a performance verification test or reject the application. 2.2 The applying student must have an active degree programme registration at his/her institution.<br />
				2.3 The applicant’s academic entry qualifications in the previous University shall be similar to that required by UDSM including the respective programme’s cut-off point in the relevant year.<br />
				3. Conditions governing credit transfer from UDSM to other Universities Transfer of credits from UDSM to other universities will be governed by the regulations of the receiving University.<br />
				4. Criteria for Establishing Equivalency of Courses<br />
				4.1 The course must be from a programme of the same level as that of UDSM i.e. Bachelors degree course for undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses for postgraduate. Courses at intermediate levels such as Advanced Diploma, or Higher Diploma levels are not acceptable.<br />
				4.2 The course must have a theoretical component i.e. involving final examination, excluding clinical-based courses.<br />
				4.3 Course content must be at least 75% similar to that of the UDSM course.<br />
				4.4 The number of teaching hours used to cover the course must not be less than 75% of those used at UDSM. 4.5 Once a course has been accepted as being equivalent to a UDSM course as per the criteria, the course shall be given the same number of units as that of the course at UDSM regardless of the units in the other University.<br />
				5. Rules for Grades Conversion<br />
				5.1 Conversion of grades shall be done by anchoring the pass mark of the other university to that of UDSM and accordingly determining the range of marks in the other University for the UDSM grades. 5.2 In the case where only grades (and not scored marks) are available, the lower equivalent grade shall be assumed.<br />
				6. Procedures and Administration of Student Credit Transfer<br />
				6.1 Applications for credit transfer should be submitted to the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic), in writing, and attaching copies of all required supporting documents.<br />
				6.2 All applications shall be scrutinized by relevant committees responsible for admission at the Department, Faculty/Institute/School/College and the Directorate of Undergraduate Studies or Graduate School (for Postgraduate applicants) levels before reaching Senate for approval.<br />
				6.3 Students transferring from other universities to UDSM shall apply for credit transfer at least three months before the beginning of the semester they want to join. Cases of UDSM’s study-abroad students shall be dealt with on case by case basis.<br />
				6.4 Supporting documents for credit transfer application shall include the following: Official transcript (to be sent by the other university) Letter of introduction/recommendation from the previous university Course description,catalogue or syllabus (to include number of hours of teaching, method of assessment and grading system)  An official translation of the original documents (in case of non-English documents) Photo-attached personal identification documents e.g. Birth certificate, passport or ID Certified copies of the original certificates used to gain admission into the previous university.<br />

				6.6 Credit transfer applicants must pay a non-refundable fee to be determined from time to time; however, UDSM students on study-abroad programmes need not pay such fees as they had already paid the fee when applying for admission into the University.</p>
